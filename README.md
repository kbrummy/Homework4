# Homework4
I'm turning this homework assignment in late, but! I really wanted to work hard on this one and try to understand JS better. Which I definitely do! I'm super proud of this project. JS is beginning to click and things are getting a little easier. 
I made a multiple choice quiz about Java Script. 
When you click "Begin Quiz!", the first question comes up, and the the timer begins in the upper right corner. 
If you answer the question correctly, you will advance to the next question. 
If you answer incorrectly, an alert comes up saying "Wrong!" and 10 seconds are deducted from the timer/score. 
Once you get through the questions, you come to the results page where you can see your score and enter your initials. 
When you submit your initials, you can see "other people's" high scores. 
You can retake the quiz, and add your next score to the list again. 
Hope you enjoy it!
